      "description" : "Thoralf Albert Skolem (23 May 1887 – 23 March 1963) was a Norwegian mathematician who worked in mathematical logic and set theory. The completeness of first-order logic is an easy corollary of results Skolem proved in the early 1920s and discussed in Skolem (1928), but he failed to note this fact, perhaps because mathematicians and logicians did not become fully aware of completeness as a fundamental metamathematical problem until the 1928 first edition of Hilbert and Ackermann's Principles of Mathematical Logic clearly articulated it.",
